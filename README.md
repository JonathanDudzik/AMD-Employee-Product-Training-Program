# My Role:
Freelance Articulate Developer

# Project description
AMD was creating a training program to teach internal employees about new products. Videos for the courses had already been created
and so my job was to create a custom video player in Articulate Storyline with closed navigation, SCORM reporting on the completion of each video,
and integration with Adobe LMS. I had to work fast as this project This project came with a very short deadline and the final product needed to match perfectly with a 
design mockup.

# Overview
I created a custom SCORM enabled video player in Storyline using custom variables, states, and JavaScript code all tied perfectly 
together using the timeline.

# Challenges
Neither the navigation nor the video controls in Storyline matched AMDâ€™s design. Additionally, the learners were only supposed to 
perform specific actions on the video, which were not possible using Storyline's player options.

# Execution
Because I could not use Storyline's player controls or the stock video controls, I turned them all off and created PNG buttons that 
matched AMD's design mockup exactly. The most critical piece of the custom controls was a script for overriding default behavior 
and adding custom play/pause buttons, captions toggling, seek controls, and a progress bar animation. Sending the SCORM communication 
at the end of the video was controlled by the state of a custom variable on the timeline when the video ended.

# Reflection
This work illustrates my expertise in Articulate Storyline and JavaScript. Faced with the challenge of matching a strict design mockup and a tight deadline, I had to go beyond Storyline's default video controls 
and learned how to completely override its player functionality by creating custom PNG buttons and integrating JavaScript to handle video controls 
and seek actions. This project also reinforced my ability to handle SCORM reporting and integrate with Adobe LMS.
